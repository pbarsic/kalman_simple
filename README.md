# kalman

This is a simple Kalman filter implementation
based on [Professor Biezen's lectures](https://youtu.be/CaCcOwJPytQ).
This is a 2D filter, intended to track objects in pixel space,
as though the (u,v) pixels are functions of time.

[This is a nice website](https://medium.com/@jaems33/understanding-kalman-filters-with-python-2310e87b8f48)
 with notes from those lectures and some sample code.
